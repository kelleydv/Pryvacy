The eagle has landed.
The duck flies at midnight.
The cheese is in the trunk.
Bite the wax tadpole.
The toothless tiger rules the ruthless jungle.
The fat man walks alone.
Negative Ghost Rider, the pattern is full.
The eagle flies at midnight.
What's the frequency Kenneth?
The hawks are circling the carcass.
May I mambo dogface to the banana patch?
The chair is against the wall.
Mickey Mouse.
Green! Green!
John has a long mustache.
After midnight all cats are gray.
These are not the droids you are looking for.
The rooster crows at midnight.
Why don't you ask the kids at Tiananmen Square?
Was fashion the reason why they were there?
Don't follow the lemmings or you'll have to take a dive.
The bird is in the oven.
